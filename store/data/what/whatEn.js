Itinerary, hotel, excursions, transfers and other services - all in one place and most importantly - at the discretion of the tourist.&nbsp;Constructor allows you to create a unique immersive tour and add to it more emotions and highlights with additional services - a cooking master class, folklore show or gala dinner. Having created an individual tour the traveler can request a free program calculation from the local travel expert.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Handmade.travel constructor is not a form for filling in tourist wishes and sending an application. With us the traveler creates his own tour, while the local expert contributes his share of expertise and shares tips and know-how.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>4.What is the difference between immersive tours and classic tours?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Handmade.travel immersive tours are exciting and colorful trips with detailed thematic itineraries in a small group of like-minded people in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The main difference from the classical product - author's solutions are developed by local travel experts who know all the details and tricks of travel in practice.

The cost of an individual tour depends on the number of participants: the more people, the cheaper the cost per person.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Guaranteed departure tour</strong> is 100% travel no matter how many people are recruited in the group. Our guaranteed tours have fixed dates and include all ground expenses: from accommodation and meals, to transfers and excursions.
